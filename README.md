## Tab Homepage.

# Allows configuring a homepage for new tabs in Chrome.

Default homepage is `chrome://apps` so new tabs show icons of installed apps. Other local `chrome://` URLs can also be set for homepage.

There may be better ways to do this, or other ways that are considered `right`! I'm simply persisting here my understanding of how to do this.
